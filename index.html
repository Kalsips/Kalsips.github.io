	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am a student who is a tech enthusiast and like to talk about new gadgets however at the same time enjoys the simplicity in life.</p>
	<p>I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer application from a Ramdeobaba College, Nagpur.</p>
	<p>I have decent coding skills and good communication skills, willing to learn new things rather than saying no to an unknown task.</p>
	<p>I like to talk to new people as I think it sometimes gives me a different perspective of looking at things which might make me a bit more creative.</p>
	<p>I enjoy writing poetries and like to express myself on paper.</p>
	<p>Someone might say I am humorous, and after ranting about myself in the above lines, if you are a bit interested to know about my professional life, please check my resume.</p>
